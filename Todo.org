[x] New todo list for hp15c alone, 2018-06-24
[x] adjust the lcd panel placement of digits
[x] adjust the lcd panel placement of indicators
[ ] adjust the lcd indicator font
[ ] figure out how to adjust fonts as the calculator resizes
[x] get rid of the 600px limit and figure out what to do instead.
[ ] figure out how to keep the menubutton with the about page.
[ ] figure out the adaptive break for portrait mode on phones
	keep the core 4x5 keypad
	but the [f] and [g] and [<-] and [on] are sort of
	essential to the works, and the other keys get used,too.
	The android calc is pretty neat, but swiping breaks the
	key concentration, pretty as it is.  Shifting sucks for
	accessability, you have to tab to the shift key, then tab
	to the operation, I should check with a user to see what
	they think.
	Which is pertinent because I'm thinking shift keys all the
	way for paging through the overlays.  Bottom row in the
	narrow layout is:
	[on] [f] [g] [o] [<-]
	where [on] is needed to clear errors, [f] and [g] for
	access to alternate key functions, [o] cycles through
	the overlays, [g][o] cycles in reverse.
[ ] reorganize the key information so that
	each key has a unique identifier which can be searched in
	code without consulting unicode.org,
	that identifier translates naturally into the actual key
	cap label by some mindless transformation,
	the key definitions are stored under the identifier,
	the key layouts are simply arrays of identifiers.
[x] the adaptive layout with overlay shifts produces multiple
	layouts containing the same keys in the same and/or
	different locations.  Wide and Narrow for now.
[ ] research accessability and calculators some more.
[x] Add back the aria-label's to the keys.
[ ] make a separate calculator page with testing enabled, use
	a concatenation of the calculator source with the test
	source and import from that.
	No, better, import the calculator through the test code,
	so test.js imports hp15c.js, and then exports it.
[ ] [on] doesn't clear the indicators.  Doesn't in the original
	simulator either.
[o] push the emits through the redux reducer, too, so we might be
	able to get keystroke macros from redux tracing.
	Won't work as I thought, repeated emits don't register as
	changes, more discussion in _shouldRender and _onEmit.
[x] test runs 17 seconds vs 10 seconds for the original, could
	move to entirely css based display where the digit and
	decimal segments are all drawn and then hidden or displayed
	according to the digits and decimals specified.  Ie, draw
	all 8's and commas, tag each segment, then set
		segment.visibility="visible"
		segment.visibility="hidden"
	according to whether the segment is needed to draw the
	desired digit or decimal.  7 segments per digit, 2 per
	decimal, 10 positions, and the negative sign.
[x] some of the arrow symbols are missing on my Android phone.
	finding a webfont link for a math friendly font is getting
	frustrating.  Just moved to the lowest numbered unicode
	code points for arrows and they work, though they're hard
	to read.
[x] rewrote all display updating to not require any render, it
	all happens in the updateState, but there are still some
	render's slipping through.
[x] adjusted the .calc{height:100vh} from 95vh.
[x] rebuilt the icon from a screenshot, 
[ ] hah, when programming, some commands depend on the alternate
	labelling of keys.  So [f][LBL] uses [A], [B], etc. as
	label targets, but the [A], [B], etc. are not displayed.
	So, the LBL, GTO, GSB entries need to activate the key
	labels that identify labels.
	And the registers want to see digits and decimals.
[ ] PRGM annunciator is outside the LCD on my phone.
[x] fixed the Re<->Im keycap, which was already marked fixed.
[ ] css fix for <sub>x</sub><sup>y</sup> non-alignnment
	.nobr {
	   white-space: nowrap;
	}
	.supsub {
	   display: inline-block;
	   margin: -9em 0;
	   vertical-align: -0.55em;
	   line-height: 1.35em;
	   font-size: 70%;
	   text-align: left;
	}
	You might already have the "nobr" class as a <nobr> replacement.
	Now to express the molecular formula for sulfate, use the "supsub"
	class as follows:
	<span class="nobr">SO<span class="supsub">2-<br />4</span></span>
